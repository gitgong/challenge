Huffman Endoding

These code samples are from my course on Complexity at Santa Fe institute. 



Some of the encoding is based upon code from Rosetta Code, however I modified it to use Maps and I wrote the decoding algorithm entirely. 

I choose to use Maps, which supports decoding process. It also is an example in which multiple data structures are used, including Tree and Queue.
